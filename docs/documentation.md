# Project Documentation – Simple Python Calculator


## 1. Project Overview

The **Simple Python Calculator** is a console-based application developed using the Python programming language.  
It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

The purpose of this mini-project is to demonstrate the use of:
- Visual Studio Code for development
- Git for version control
- GitHub for repository hosting
- Proper documentation practices

This project is created as part of the subject **Computer Science Fundamentals & Career Pathways (ETCCCP105)**.



## 2. Tools and Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Editor**: Visual Studio Code
- **Version Control System**: Git
- **Hosting Platform**: GitHub
- **Operating System**: Windows



## 3. Development Process

The project was developed in the following steps:

1. A new project folder was created and opened in Visual Studio Code.
2. Git repository was initialized using `git init`.
3. The main Python file (`main.py`) was created.
4. Separate functions were written for each operation:
   - `add()`
   - `subtract()`
   - `multiply()`
   - `divide()`
5. A menu-driven interface was created using a `while` loop.
6. Error handling was added to:
   - Prevent division by zero
   - Handle invalid (non-numeric) input
7. Output was formatted to give clean results up to 2 decimal points.
8. The project was committed multiple times with meaningful commit messages.
9. The project was pushed to GitHub for hosting.
10. Screenshots were taken and added to the repository.


## 4. Key Features of the Project

- Simple and user-friendly command-line interface
- Menu-based selection of operations
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully
- Prevents division by zero errors
- Uses functions for clean and modular code
- Supports repeated calculations
- Proper documentation and version control



## 5. Challenges Faced

Some challenges faced during development:

- Handling incorrect user inputs
- Preventing program crash during divide by zero
- Understanding how Git and GitHub worked
- Learning how to make meaningful commits

These challenges helped improve problem-solving and debugging skills.



## 6. Future Improvements

In the future, the calculator can be enhanced by:

- Adding more operations (modulus, square, square root, power)
- Creating a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter
- Adding a history feature to save previous calculations
- Adding unit testing for automatic checking
- Deploying it as a web application



## 7. Conclusion

This mini-project helped in understanding the real-world use of:
- Programming concepts
- Version control
- Software development tools
- Documentation standards

It also improved practical skills in Python, Git, and GitHub.

The project successfully meets all the objectives of the given assignment.
